# Voice Live API Refactoring - Direct Audio Streaming

## Changes Made

This refactoring updates the application to send audio directly from the user's microphone to the Voice Live API instead of using Azure Speech Recognition as an intermediary.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Controller Updates (`Controllers/ChatController.cs`)
- **Removed Azure Speech Recognition dependencies**: No longer using `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` SDK
- **Added direct audio streaming endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/chat/send-audio` - Accepts base64-encoded audio data and sends it directly to Voice Live API
  - Updated `toggle-voice` endpoint to work with direct audio streaming
- **New Voice Live API message handling**:
  - `input_audio_buffer.append` - Sends audio chunks to Voice Live API
  - `input_audio_buffer.clear` - Clears audio buffer when starting recording
  - `input_audio_buffer.commit` - Commits audio buffer for processing when stopping recording
  - Added handlers for `speech_started`, `speech_stopped`, and `audio_committed` events

#### 2. Frontend Updates (`Pages/Index.cshtml`)
- **Web Audio API integration**: 
  - Uses `getUserMedia()` to capture microphone input directly
  - Implements `AudioContext` and `ScriptProcessorNode` for real-time audio processing
  - Converts Float32 audio to PCM16 format required by Voice Live API
- **Real-time audio level monitoring**:
  - Visual audio level indicator with progress bar
  - Real-time feedback showing microphone input levels
- **Enhanced audio constraints**:
  - Configured for 24kHz sample rate (Voice Live API requirement)
  - Enabled echo cancellation, noise suppression, and auto gain control
- **Improved user feedback**:
  - Audio status indicator
  - Real-time visual feedback during recording
  - Better error handling and user notifications

#### 3. Dependencies
- **Removed**: `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech` package
- **Excluded**: `OtherProgram.cs` from compilation (console application using Speech SDK)

### Technical Benefits

1. **Reduced latency**: Audio is sent directly to Voice Live API without Speech-to-Text conversion
2. **Better audio quality**: Raw audio data preserves all audio information for Voice Live processing
3. **Simplified architecture**: Eliminates the need for Azure Speech Recognition service
4. **Enhanced features**: Voice Live API can now use its advanced semantic VAD and turn detection
5. **Real-time feedback**: Users can see audio levels and recording status in real-time

### Audio Flow

**Before**: Microphone ? Azure Speech Recognition ? Text ? Voice Live API
**After**: Microphone ? Direct PCM16 Audio Stream ? Voice Live API

### Browser Requirements

- Modern browser with Web Audio API support
- Microphone access permissions
- HTTPS connection (required for `getUserMedia()`)

### Usage

1. Click "Connect" to establish connection with Voice Live API
2. Click "?? Start Voice" to begin audio streaming
3. Speak into the microphone - audio is sent directly to Voice Live API
4. Voice Live API detects speech boundaries and processes audio
5. Click "?? Stop Voice" to end audio streaming and commit audio for processing
6. AI responds with both text and audio output

This refactoring provides a more direct and efficient way to interact with the Voice Live API while maintaining all existing functionality.
